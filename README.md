# streamlit-app-bike-rentals-simulator

This is a project that I worked on with a friend to test the different functionalities of StreamLit and build our first StreamLit app. We were curious about the possibilities of what we would be able to
build using just a Jupyter notebook. We could have gone even farther than what we did but had to find a limit as we were then more occupied by prioritary and mandatory work.
We used the dataset of a bike rental company in Washington and built a ML model to be able to use it in a simulator that predicts the number of bike rentals based on metrics that can be
modified at will by the user on our Streamlit app. We also pre-empted this with a big part of data visualization as we wanted to see how to have more aesthetically pleasing graphs and figures 
than in VisualStudioCode. 
Please make sure to check it out here : https://pythonfinal.streamlit.app/
You can then check the Jupyter Notebook in the repository.
Thank you!
